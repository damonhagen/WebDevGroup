    <p>The 8 Bit Synth<p>
<br>
    <p>The 8 Bit Synthesizer is a virtual instrument that simulates the 8 bit sonic textures of vintage Atari or Commodore 64 video games. It can be used to apply experimental sound effects to a song. There is an entry field in which random numbers or symbols can be entered to create a sound without the need of applying traditional sound design techniques.</p>

<br><br>    
    <p>The Bassline Synth</p>
<br>     
    <p>The Bassline is the ideal synthesizer to achieve sounds similar to the classic Roland synthesizer called the TB-303 invented in 1984, which gives your composed basslines either a piercing or squelching effect.Using it for higher pitched melodies is also a useful method throughout the production process. This sonic texture has been an asset in styles such as Electro and Techno since the inception of those genres of music.</p>

<br><br>     
    <p>BeatBox</p>
<br>
    <p>BeatBox is virtual drum module that allows you to load wav files into each of the instrument’s 10 available slots. They can either be loaded from Caustic’s own provided library or custom folders that contain wav files of your own. Although this instrument suggests to load up drum oriented sounds, it can be just as effective by loading melodic sound bits or sound effects as long as they are in wav file format.</p>

    <img src=“FMsynth.png” alt=“caustic fmsynth”>
<br><br> 
    <p>FM Synth</p>
<br> 
    <p>If you are looking for the ideal simulator of FM synthesis, this is your goto virtual instrument. Its sound is based upon hardware synthesizers that were invented in the mid 1980s that generated textures by music programmers, varying parameters of digital synthesis wave tables. The FM Synth is useful for creating melodic or percussive textures that mimic the sound of glass, metal or hollow objects. With tactful programming it can go outside its own spectrum and emulate both FM and analog synthesis ideal for industrialized basslines or otherworldly melodies.</p>

    <img src=“modular synth.png” alt=“caustic modular synth”>
<br><br> 
    <p>Modular</p>
<br> 
    <p>The first commercially used modular synthesizers go as far back as the 1960s, and are still highly sought out for by music producers of all influences today. Modular synthesis, usually based upon good old fashioned analog synthesis, is what helps make any recording sound timeless in character. Vintage synthesizers originally produced sounds out of voltage fluctuations instead of binary code, and it has been said that they produce more lifelike or organic sound textures in comparison to the average digital synthesizer. Caustic’s Modular Synth provides today’s composers the same versatile layout of inputs, cables, knobs and sliders to work with, allowing for countless possibilities in your final sound patch. A sound patch that can be immediately saved instead of writing your settings down on paper, as it often was done up to the early 1980s.</p>

<br><br> 
    <p>The Pad Synth</p>
<br> 
    <p>The Pad Synth is capable of producing an array of sounds but excels when it comes to New-Age influenced sounds such as melodic bells, vocal-like choirs as well as sonic impressions of wind or water. It can be equally useful as a sound source for those into producing ambient music or film scores.</p>

    <img src=“PCMsynth.png” alt=“caustic pcmsynth”>
<br><br> 
    <p>PCM Synth</p>
<br> 
    <p>The PCM Synth can load up part of Caustic’s onboard wav format samples, or a custom library of your own wav files instead. This virtual instrument can be used to compose percussive sequences or melodies of any kind depending on which type of wav files you implement. Loaded sounds can be played at different pitches or speeds across the instrument’s virtual keyboard. The PCM Synth has a classic synth control panel, offering similar editing features you would find on a classic analog/hardware instrument.</p>
    <p>Click the links below to hear PCM Synth sound demos. Note that the 2nd example is the unit playing a custom wav file sample passing through the unit’s filters.</p>

<br><br> 
    <p>The Sub Synth</p>
<br> 
    <p>The Sub Synth simulates the sonic textures of vintage analog synthesizers and is capable of producing sub-harmonic</p>
    <p>tones when working with its onboard sine based waveforms. Such frequencies will remind you of rumbling drone-like</p>
    <p>effects than can be either melodic or experimental. It is just as capable when it comes to incorporating melodies</p>
    <p>than are in the mid range frequency spectrum and sweeping sound effects are also possible.</p>

<br><br> 
    <p>Vocoder</p>
<br> 
    <p>The Vocoder is commonly used to add robotic effects to vocals, rhythms of melodies and can give certain tracks in your songs a futuristic character. Any signal that is processed by the unit will act as this instrument’s sound source or “carrier” to be effected by the available applied parameters. You will get a highly distinguishable effect that has been commonly used in styles such as Ambient Electronica, Electro-Pop and Vintage Breakdance music.
