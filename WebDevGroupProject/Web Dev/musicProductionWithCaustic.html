    <h3>Choose Your Virtual Instruments</h3>

    <p>You are first presented with fourteen empty slots in order to select one of the many instruments Caustic has to offer. The four other available screen views immediately at your disposal include the instrument effect sends, main mixing console, master section and song sequencer/arranger.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Enter Notes in Each Instrument's Grid</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Click anywhere on the grid to place your notes one at a time to form a melody. Press the play button near the lower right corner of the screen to have your sequence play back continuously in a loop. Adjust notes as required to refine your melody until you find it sounds right. You can store up to 64 melodic patterns per instrument, as Banks A through D will each allow you to enter a maximum of 16 melodic patterns, or drum rhythms if composing with Caustic's Beat Box instrument instead.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Give Each Instrument Designated Effects</h3>
    <br>
    <p>You can send each instrument's sound through a pair of effects before they reach your virtual mixing console. This allows you to add an atmospheric presence or echoes with effects such as Reverb or Delay. You can also either gently or harshly squash your chosen sound by using the Compressor effect.</p>

    <img src="adjustinstrumentvolumesonthemixer.png" alt="caustic app mixer view">
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Adjust Instrument Volumes on the Mixer</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Each instrument you composed a rhythm or melody with can now have its own volume set to just the right level, so your combination of composed parts will sound balanced. There are up to seven channels to be used for your instruments.</p>
    <p>Upon adding an eighth instrument, a second mixer will automatically appear giving you a total of fourteen instrument tracks to edit and work with. If you had run out of effect options in the previous step, the mixer provides each of your instrument channels with a reverb and delay effect that are fully adjustable in Caustic's master section.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Call Up Your Melodies in the Song's Main Sequencer</h3>
    <br>
    <p>By clicking inside the grid of the sequencer view you can designate when and which melody will begin to play according to the location you are on the song's timeline. The song's timeline is displayed across the lower part of the screen and is counted or measured in beats. It is often good common practice to extend how long your melody will run by using increments of either 4, 8 or 16 beats at a time. This method is recommended unless you are going for a result that is either less conventional or experimental.</p>
    <p>If you extend a part past the original duration of your initial composition(s) the melody will loop continuously until the extension reaches your chosen end point.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Season Your Mix in the Master Section</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This view allows you to add equalization to your entire mix in order to increase or decrease your song's overall frequency response in the areas needed most. Caustic's equalizer gives you five frequency bands to adjust. A limiter effect is also available and is commonly used. It's key ability is to make sure that any individual sound that was previously difficult to balance in volume does not come in too loud, when it is at its loudest occurrence during playback. This section also allows for the mixer's delay and reverb unit parameters to be finely tuned to your liking. Caustic's virtual work environment demonstrates that song production can be achieved within six easy steps, with advanced refinement being only a matter of devoted time and self-gained expertise learned along the way.</p>
