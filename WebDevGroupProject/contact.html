        <h1>Developer Of Caustic 3</h1>
        <h1>Rej</h1>
       <p>Rej invented the caustic app. He was intrested in music from his childhood.
           He did piano lesson in the age of 8 and become a band player in his teen years.
           His father bought a Commodore 64 when he was only 8. Then he managed to figure out the really simple commands.
           Then his interest developed toward programming.
           He have a whole pile of half-finished programs and games for Windows, but the first big one he did was a 3D editor. 
           You could create models in 3D, apply materials, animation etc. He couldn't justify paying for bigger 3D suites and he wanted to make models for his games so he made him own editor!
           Then he come toward the Android because his friend sold him a game engine Nexus One.
           This help him to get into apps. He told that if anyone wants to do any kind of programming then he should find a goal.
           And with the practice he move toward his goals.
           One day he was brainstorming ideas with his friend. After his friend gave him the Nexus One. His initial idea was because the device had a GPS, maybe he could create some kind of generative music app where the beat that played depended on your location and it would be unique for each location. He thought it would be cool because then he could tell his friends "come stand in front of his house and listen" or .. "try standing by that dumpster, it's a really cool beat".
           His friend then said that his first step should be to create a simple synth, which he did and then his friend said that Why don't he just make a music creation app, there aren't that many good ones on Android.
           Then he developed caustic music apps. He develop caustic 1 to caustic 3 app.
